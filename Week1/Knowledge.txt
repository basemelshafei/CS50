Binary = 0 or 1
Bit = the smallest unit of structure for a computer which holds a binary outcome either 0 or 1
Byte = 8 bits  00000000 -> 11111111 : 0 -> 255 (256)
ASCII = any letter or number can be represented in byte 
Unicode = more general that ASCII, uses 1/2/3/4 Bytes 
All colors are combinations of RGB (red,green,blue) -> 255,255,255
Images are represented as pixels -> a pixel is a color 
Videos = multiple images played sequentially (frames) 
input -> Algorithm -> output
Algorithm -> the steps to solve a problem in a fast way 
Always try to split 50/50 am i closer to the first 50 or last 50 and move on to get closer to your target (removing half of the work each iteration)
Consider all possibilities when writing code, they should all be represented if A then 1 elif B then 2 ... else 0 
Pesoudocode -> your Algorithm in plain simple English, before it is moved to the right syntax
Easiest programming language is SCRATCH. it is a visualization based software to write program
Functions are defined, they are tailored with arguments / parameters, parameters can be defined in function (static) or fed to the function (dynamic)
